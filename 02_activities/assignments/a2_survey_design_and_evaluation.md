# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `#1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The survey is designed to identify the reasons behind the high turnover rates among the entry- and lower-level employees. The survey aims to gather feedback on job satisfation, workplace culture, and management practices (i.e. mentor-mentee relationship). The results will help guide organizational changes needed to improve employee retention. 
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
The target population is all curent and recently departed employees who work at entry- and lower-levels within the company.
The sampling frame is a list of current and past entry- and lower-level employees from the company database.
The sampling units are individual employeers with entry- and lower-level positions.
The observational units are the individual employees who responded to the survey.
```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. How long have you been (or were you) employed with the company?
2. How satisfied are/were you with your overall job experience?
3. Which of the following factors most influenced your decision to stay/leave? (Options: compensation/ career growth and opportunities/ company culture/ management style / others (specify).
4. Are you receveing adequate mentorship/ training from your leaders/ managers?
5. How would you rate your communication and support from your supervisors/managers? (1-5 with 1 being very poor and 5 being excellent)
6. Would you recommend this company to a friend as a good place to work?
7. Any additional comments you'd like to share?

```

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
1. Sample type: the survey used stratified random sampling (information is collected from 1 randomly selected household member aged 15 or older, and proxy responses are not permitted). Stratification was done based on geographical areas of each provinces. The survey also used 'rejective sampling' where after a respondent was identified as volunteer/ not-volunteer, a subsampling is done for the selected, non-volunteer respondents. All selected volunteer respondents did a long interview, while the non-volunteer group was split in half (one half did a long interview, and the other half did a short interview). 
2. Sample size: field sample of ~50,000 individuals, of which 40,000 received an invitation letters to the questionnaires. ~ 24,000 responses to the questionnaires were expected. 
3. Target population: all persons 15 years of age and older living in the 10 provinces of Canada, excluding full-time residents of institutions. 
4. Sampling frame: landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and other administrative sources with Statistics Canada's dwelling frame. 
5. Survey mode(s): electronic questionaires and computer assisted telephone interviewing. 
6. Timeline: from Sep 4th, 2018 to Dec 28th, 2018.
7. Response rate: 41.9%
8. Weights: estimation weights (which was used to compensate for non-response and ensure that the results are representative of the target population)
9. Data processing: Error detection includes check for family relationships, age, response flows. 
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc.: Missing/ inconsistent data were addressed through imputation, which was done in 9 steps: imputing personal and family income (step 1), imputing the formal volunteering variables (steps 2-4), imputing the informal volunteering variables (steps 5-6), imputing variables in the donation file and solicitation methods (steps 7-9). 
11. Sources of error: sampling erros, coverage errors (imperfect coverage), non-response bias.
12. Limitations, known biases, etc.: Limitations: the survey did not include residents from the territories and full-time institutional residents. Bias: the survey is based on self-reported data, which often have recall bias and social desirability bias.
